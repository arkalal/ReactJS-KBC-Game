# How the KBC Game works? Things to Know!

1. The game has been developed by using only React Pure states and props drilling methods through components..

2. I have also used React Map loop function along with useRef React hooks to setup the user registration page..

3. The quiz correct wrong logic has been developed using Javascript objects to store the data of the answers of the questions along with a boolean value. The map loop has been used to get all the data and fetch it to the quiz box. 

4. Boolean methods and if else statements has been used to setup the correct wrong asnwer logic of the game.

5. The correct wrong animations has been developed with the help Vanilla CSS.

6. The timer has been developed in a seperate component with the help of React pure states and useEffect Hook along with the use of setInerval() and clearInterval() functions.


I hope you like my project and enjoy playing the game and you can also check all the files in my repository to find out I have developed the game using my ReactJS Skills.
